<h1> Hello and welcome to my Space X capstone project repository </h1>
<p> These notebooks I have uploaded from work I have done using the IBM watson platform and with the direction of the <br>
  content covered in the IBM and coursera course. This course gives the student an understanding of the utility of applying <br>
  data science methodology, the methods involved, programming for data analysis and visualisation. It allowed me to have real <br>
experience using machine learning algorithms to solve a real business problem. The final project is an exploration of the data <br>
from Space X and their Falcon 9 rocket. It explores the launch locations, the success rate of both launching and landing and allows <br>
us to analyse the reusability of the rockets. </p>

<p> If you are working on your own version of the capstone project, I hope what I have here is of some use. There are many repos on <br>
  Github that have made much better presentations than mine but our code and insight is fairly similar. If you are stuck and need some <br>
  inspiration, I hope the resources you find here will help. Good luck with the course. </p>
