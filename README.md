<h1> Hello and welcome to my Space X capstone project repository </h1>
<p> These notebooks I have uploaded from work I have done using the IBM watson platform and the direction of the content 
  covered in the IBM and coursera course. This course gives the student an understanding of the utility of applying data 
  science methodology, the methods involved, programming for data analysis and visualisation. It allowed me to have real 
experience using machine learning algorithms to solve a real business problem. This final project is an explores Space X 
  data, and their Falcon 9 rocket. It explores the launch locations, the success rate of both launching and landing and 
  allows us to analyse the reusability of the rockets. </p>

<p> If you are working on your own version of the capstone project, I hope what I have here is of some use. There are many  
  repos on Github that have made much better presentations than mine but our code and insight is fairly similar. If you are 
  stuck and need some inspiration, I hope the resources you find here will help. Good luck with the course. </p>
